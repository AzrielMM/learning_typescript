# learning_typescript
A collection of Typescript ideas and practice problems that I've attempted. These range from random functions that probably have no use in a real project to modular extensions and functions that could be useful in anything.

<br>
<h2>./dist files</h2>
The files within ./dist are the project's Typescript (.ts) files that have been compiled into Javascript (.js) files that can be run within a browser or Node.js

<br>
<h2>./scripts files</h2>
Everything inside of ./scripts is either a Typescript (.ts) script or a Typescript (.ts) module. These are compiled into the ./dist directory.

<br>
<h2>./tests files</h2>
The scripts within ./tests are meant to test the different functions and modules within the ./scripts directory.
